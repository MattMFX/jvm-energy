/Users/mfmachado/.matplotlib is not a writable directory
Matplotlib created a temporary cache directory at /var/folders/xb/mct6xjnn3djfbdglg78zr7f80000gn/T/matplotlib-pg7kkxks because there was an issue with the default path (/Users/mfmachado/.matplotlib); it is highly recommended to set the MPLCONFIGDIR environment variable to a writable directory, in particular to speed up the import of Matplotlib and to better support multiprocessing.
Matplotlib is building the font cache; this may take a moment.
